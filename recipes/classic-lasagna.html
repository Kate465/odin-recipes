    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>eggs</li>
      <li>basil</li>
      <li>cheese</li>
      <li>Lasanga noodles</li>
      <li>Ground beef</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook ground beef and sausage in a large pot over medium heat; drain.
        Stir in tomato sauce, mushrooms, garlic salt, oregano, thyme, and basil;
        season with salt and black pepper. Simmer 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook
        lasagna noodles with olive oil in the boiling water, stirring
        occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, combine ricotta cheese, eggs, and Parmesan cheese in a bow
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with a thin layer of meat sauce;
        layer 3 lasagna noodles over top. Spread about 1/3 ricotta cheese
        mixture over noodles; sprinkle about 1/4 mozzarella cheese over top.
        Spoon about 1/3 meat sauce over mozzarella cheese. Repeat layering twice
        more, finishing with remaining mozzarella cheese
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese melts and sauce bubbles, about
        90 minutes. Cover lasagna with foil if cheese begins to get too dark.
        Let sit before serving for 10 to 15 minutes
      </li>
